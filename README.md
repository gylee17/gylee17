## Hi, I'm Jane ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Master's student at the University of Chicago studying data science.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced techniques in courses including Data Engineering, Statistical Models, Machine Learning, and Time Series Analysis.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, SQL, R, Tableau, IT audits, or data-driven decision-making.
